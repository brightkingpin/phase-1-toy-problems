Toy Problems
This is a collection of three toy problems: Student Grade Generator, Speed Detector, and Net Salary Calculator.

Description
The Student Grade Generator program prompts the user to input student marks between 0 and 100, and outputs the corresponding grade as follows:

A > 79
B - 60 to 79
C - 59 to 49
D - 40 to 49
E - less than 40
The Speed Detector program takes the speed of a car as input, and if the speed is less than 70, it prints "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the program prints "License suspended".

The Net Salary Calculator program calculates an individual's net salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. It calculates the payee (i.e. tax), NHIF deductions, NSSF deductions, gross salary, and net salary using the tax rates provided by the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF), and the National Social Security Fund (NSSF).

The tax rates used in this program are based on the following sources:

KRA: www.kra.go.ke/en/individual/calculate-tax/calculating-tax/paye
NHIF and NSSF: www.aren.co.ke/payroll/taxrates.htm
